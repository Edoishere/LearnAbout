## What I need?
I need:
- Account [Git Hub](https://github.com/)
- A place where we can programming, I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

<a name="github" />

## GitHub

I create a repository for, a sort of, personal web site. To do this I use [Github.io](https://pages.github.com/?(null))

## How to import data in Python?
  The most common library that you have to use to import data in Python is [pandas](pandas).

## Useful Libraries
Some Python libraries:

<a name="numpy" />

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/#)

  NumPy can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import numpy as np
  
<a name="matplotlib" />

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html#)

  Matplotlib can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
<a name="pandas" />

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

  Pandas can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import pandas as pd
  
<a name="scikit" />
  
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

  Scikit-learn has a focus on supervised learning and provides a range of algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering. It also has tools for feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.
  Some examples of Scikit-learn:
  > from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  
  > from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  
  > from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  
  > from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  
  > from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
  
<a name="tensorflow" />
  
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=it)
  
  TensorFlow can be imported in Python as follow:
  > import tensorflow as tf
  
<a name="pytorch" />
  
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
  
  PyTorch can be imported in Python as follow:
  > import torch
  
  There is a useful version of PyTorch to do GNN and [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/colabs.html) there is a course.
  
<a name="keras" />
  
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

  Keras is a high-level machine learning library that is built on top of TensorFlow. It is designed to make it easy to build and train deep learning models. Keras provides a range of layers and models that can be used to build neural networks and other machine learning models.
  Keras can be imported in Python as follow:
  > import tensorflow as tf
  > from tensorflow import keras

<a name="streamlit" />

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

  Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps.
