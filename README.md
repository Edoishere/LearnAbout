# Useful Libraries
Some Python libraries:
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/#)
  NumPy can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import numpy as np
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html#)
  Matplotlib can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  Pandas can be imported in Python as follows:
  > import pandas as pd
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  Scikit-learn has a focus on supervised learning and provides a range of algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering. It also has tools for feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.
  Some examples of Scikit-learn:
  > from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
  > from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  > from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  > from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
  > from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
